# JSLinker
## Objective
Merge (without overwritting) .js files all into one coherent .html file.
## Benefits
* This program makes it easy to transfer a single HTML file between servers and also provides a much more streamlined javascripting experience on browsers.
* Instead of using <script src="jsfile.js"></script>, it will combine all of these and put the source code inside an HTML file.
* When a user saves the website, it saves all of the javascript source code as well
## Features
* The code is very minimal and uses templates. These can be changed according to your use.
* Everything is streamlined and straightforward. No hassle or extra configuration.
## System requirements
* GNU/Linux system with bash
## Instructions
